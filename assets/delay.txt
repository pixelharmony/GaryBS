gave me a hickey
tried to kill me
ran me over
died in front of me
tried to seduce me
beat me into submission
hid my pencils
stole my bycicle
stole your desks
stole my identity
slept with my uncle
broke into my house
came on me
texted racial slurs from my phone
round house kicked me and said "Roadhouse!"
tried to sell me smaller desks
pooped in the games room
made me find Jesus
