I'm sorry but
Please forgive me
Beg you a thousand pardons
I apologize, however
I'm never usually like this but
You're never going to believe this but
Guess what happened,
Holy shit! get this
Do I have a story for you
So i was minding my own business and boom,
The most unbelievable thing just happened,
I couldn't be more apologetic but
Sorry I'm late
I couldn't go because
I couldn't help it
This is a terrible excuse but
This is going to sound crazy but
Blimey! Sorry I'm late
My bad
I swear it wasn't my fault
I feel terrible, but
Don't blame me
